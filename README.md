Feature #1: **Course-Selection:** The project can add selected course into the selection list

Feature #2: **User-Friendly-Alerts:** The project uses alert notifications to send the user a timely feedback of their actions, offering better user experience

Feature #3: **Smart-Indexing:** It indexes the selected course according to the order of selection and avoids repeatations


**State in the project:**
I have used state in several different occassion in the project. State was first used to load the data and put it inside an array. Later State is used to update the time element, the selection list and the price element as the primary functions. I used a handleAddToSelections function to add the selected coursed in the list and thus funtionally using another state.
